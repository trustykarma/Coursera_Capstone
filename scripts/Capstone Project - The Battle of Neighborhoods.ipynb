    "The final project will be exploring the cultural similarities of New York and Toronto. Both major cities are labeled as one of the most multicultural cities in the world, but what makes them so diverse from other cities might make them similair to each other. I will be looking at the different types of cultural venues to answer this quesiton. Finding out which business are popular among these two diverse cities and possibly what is more popular in one or the other. If your looking to move to a cultural city with specific interests or trying to open a art gallery to express yourself, which city has what your looking for."
